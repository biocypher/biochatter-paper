## Abstract

Current-generation Large Language Models (LLMs) have stirred enormous interest in recent months thanks to their great potential for accessibility and automation, but they also present significant challenges and risks of misuse.
In response to these issues within the biomedical space, we propose BioChatter, an open-source framework designed to facilitate safe interaction with LLMs while maintaining sensible constraints on their use.
BioChatter synergises the many functionalities from open-source software packages currently developed around LLMs including knowledge integration / retrieval-augmented generation, model chaining, and benchmarking.
Focusing on robustness and user-friendliness, BioChatter's implementation results in an easy-to-use and inclusive framework for application in many use cases of biomedicine, with methods to deploy privacy-preserving local LLMs.
We showcase its utility via two multi-purpose web apps ([https://chat.biocypher.org](https://chat.biocypher.org)) and provide comprehensive documentation, support, and a welcoming open community.

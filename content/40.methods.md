## Methods

BioChatter is a Python library, currently supporting Python 3.10-3.12, and generally the three most recent releases, which we ensure with a continuous integration pipeline on GitHub.
ChatGSE is a web app based on the Streamlit framework (version 1.21.0, https://streamlit.io), which is written in Python and can be deployed locally or on a server (https://github.com/biocypher/ChatGSE).
It is mainly used for demonstrating the various applications of the BioChatter framework and API.
<!-- TODO update web app, preview -->
For an up-to-date overview and preview of current functionality of the platform, please visit the [online preview](https://chat.biocypher.org).
ChatGSE Next (https://github.com/biocypher/chatgse-next) is a modern web app with server-client architecture, based on the open-source template of ChatGPT-Next-Web (https://github.com/ChatGPTNextWeb/ChatGPT-Next-Web).
It is written in TypeScript using Flask and Node.js and demonstrates the use of BioChatter in a modern web app.
All packages are developed openly and according to modern standards of software development [@doi:10.1038/s41597-020-0486-7]; we use the permissive MIT licence to encourage downstream use and development.
We include a code of conduct and contributor guidelines to offer accessibility and inclusivity to all that are interested in contributing to the framework.

### Benchmarking

The benchmarking framework implements a matrix of component combinations using the parameterisation feature of Pytest [@pytest].
This allows the automated evaluation of all possible combinations of components, such as LLMs, prompts, and datasets.
The results are stored in a database and displayed on the website for easy comparison.
The benchmark is updated upon the release of new models and extensions to the datasets.
The individual dimensions of the matrix are:

- **LLMs**: Testing proprietary (OpenAI) and open-source models (commonly using the Xorbits Inference API and HuggingFace models) against the same set of tasks is the primary aim of our benchmarking framework. We facilitate the automation of testing by including a programmatic way of deploying open-source models.

- **prompts**: Since model performance can rely on prompts dramatically, a set of prompts for each task with varying degrees of specificity and fixed as well as variable components is used to evaluate this variability.

- **datasets**: We test various tasks using a set of datasets for each task in question-answer-style.

- **data processing**: Some data processing steps can have great impact on the downstream performance of LLMs. For instance, we test the conversion of numbers (which LLMs are notoriously bad at handling) to categorical text (e.g., low, medium, high).

- **model quantisations**: We test a set of quantisations for each model (where available) to account for the trade-off between model size and performance.

- **model parameters**: Where suitable, we test a set of parameters for each model, such as "temperature," which determines the reproducibility of model responses.

- **integrations**: We write dedicated tests for specific tasks that require integrations, for instance with knowledge graphs or vector databases.

- **stochasticity**: To account for variablity in model responses, we include a parameter to run each test multiple times and generate summary statistics.

The Pytest framework is implemented at https://github.com/biocypher/biochatter/blob/main/benchmark, and more information and results are available at https://biocypher.github.io/biochatter/benchmark.

To prevent leakage of benchmarking data (and subsequent contamination of future LLMs), we implement an encryption routine on the benchmark datasets.
The encryption is performed using a hybrid encryption scheme, where the data is encrypted with a symmetric key, which is in turn encrypted with an asymmetric key.
The datasets are stored in a dedicated encrypted pipeline that is only accessible to the workflow that executes the benchmark.
These processes are implemented at https://github.com/biocypher/llm-test-dataset and accessed from the benchmark procedure in BioChatter.

### Knowledge Graphs

We utilise the close connection between BioChatter and the BioCypher framework [@biocypher] to integrate knowledge graph (KG) queries into the BioChatter API.
In the BioCypher KG creation, we use a configuration file to map KG contents to ontology terms, including information about each of the entities.
For instance, we detail the properties of a node and the source and target classes of an edge.
Additionally, during the KG build process, we enrich this information and save it to a YAML file and, optionally, directly to the KG.
This information is used by BioChatter to tune its understanding of the KG, which allows the LLM to query the KG more efficiently.
By understanding the context of the KG, the exact contents, and the exact spelling of all identifiers and properties, we effectively support the LLM in generating correct queries.
To illustrate the usage of this feature, we provide a demonstration repository at https://github.com/biocypher/pole including a KG build procedure and ChatGSE app, which can be run using a single Docker Compose command.

### Retrieval Augmented Generation

While the general knowledge of current LLMs is extensive, they may not know how to prioritise very specific scientific results, or they may not have had access to some research articles in their training data (e.g., due to their recency or licensing issues).
To bridge this gap, we can provide additional information from relevant publications to the model via the prompt.
However, we cannot add entire publications to the prompt, since the input length of current models still is restricted; we need to isolate the information that is specifically relevant to the question given by the user.
To find this information, we perform a semantic similarity search between the user’s question and the contents of user-provided scientific articles (or other texts).
The most efficient way to do this mapping is by using a vector database.

The contextual background information provided by the user (e.g., by uploading a scientific article of prior work related to the experiment to be interpreted) is split into pieces suitable to be digested by the LLM, which are individually embedded by the model.
These embeddings (represented by vectors) are used to store the text fragments in a vector database; the storage as vectors allows fast and efficient retrieval of similar entities via the comparison of individual vectors.
For example, the two sentences “Amyloid beta levels are associated with Alzheimer’s Disease stage.” and “One of the most important clinical markers of AD progression is the amount of deposited A-beta 42.” would be closely associated in a vector database (given the embedding model is of sufficient quality, i.e., similar to GPT-3 or better), while traditional text-based similarity metrics probably would not identify them as highly similar.

By comparing the user’s question to prior knowledge in the vector database, we can extract the relevant pieces of information from the entire background.
Even better, we can first use an LLM to generate an answer to the user's question and then use this answer to query the vector database for relevant information.
Regardless of whether the initial answer is correct, it is likely that the "fake answer" is more semantically similar to the relevant pieces of information than the user's question [@doi:10.48550/arXiv.2308.07107].
Semantic search results (for instance, single sentences directly related to the topic of the question) are then sufficiently small to be added to the prompt.
In this way, the model can learn from additional context without the need for retraining or fine-tuning.
This method is sometimes described as in-context learning [@doi:10.48550/arxiv.2303.17580] or retrieval-augmented generation [@rag].

To provide access to this functionality in BioChatter, we implement classes for the connection to, and management of, vector database systems (in the vectorstore_host.py module), and for performing semantic search on the vector database and injecting the results into the prompt (in the vectorstore.py module).
To demonstrate the use of the API, we add a “Retrieval Augmented Generation” tab to the ChatGSE preview app that allows the upload of text documents to be added to a vector database, which then can be queried to add contextual information to the prompt sent to the primary model.
This contextual information is transparently displayed.
Since this functionality requires a connection to a vector database system, we provide connectivity to a Milvus server, including a way to start the server in conjunction with a BioCypher knowledge graph and the ChatGSE app in one Docker Compose workflow.

### Deployment of Open-Source Models

To facilitate access to open-source models, we adopt a flexible deployment framework based on the Xorbits Inference API [@{https://github.com/xorbitsai/inference}].
We provide Docker images for the automatic deployment of the API and the models.
Xorbits Inference includes a large number of open-source models out of the box, and new models from Hugging Face Hub [@{https://huggingface.co/}] can be added using the intuitive graphical user interface.

To enhance the accessibility of BioChatter, we have introduced a WebAssembly (WASM) deployment of Language Models (LLMs), leveraging the web-llm library available at https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm. 
This deployment is accessible through webGPU-compatible browsers, including Chrome version >113, Edge >113, Opera >99, and Firefox nightly builds. 
The WASM binary, compiled using the web-llm library, is integrated into the server docker image, making it seamlessly available to the BioChatter server within ChatGSE-Next.
This innovative approach not only ensures a secure conversational environment but also mitigates the risks associated with potential data breaches. 
For instance, the ChatGSE-Next server can be hosted within a local network or even on a local computer. 
Utilizing the hosted LLM model requires no internet connection or powerful server; instead, computational power is drawn directly from the user's browser. 
This deployment method guarantees complete data security and is only constrained by the resources of the user's computer. 
While achieving a similar outcome is possible with a local deployment of the Xorbits Inference API, the browser-based deployment stands out for its user-friendly interface and superior scalability. 
This approach enhances the overall user experience, making BioChatter more accessible and efficient for a broader audience.

### Model Chaining

The ability of LLMs to control external software, including other LLMs, opens up a wide range of possibilities for the orchestration of complex tasks.
A simple example is the implementation of a correcting agent, which receives the output of the primary model and checks it for factual correctness.
If the agent detects an error, it can prompt the primary model to correct its output, or forward this correction to the user directly.
Since this relies on the internal knowledge base of the correcting agent, the same caveats apply, as the correcting agent may confabulate as well.
However, since the agent is independent of the primary model (being set up with dedicated prompts), it is less likely to confabulate in the same way.

This approach can be extended to a more complex model chain, where the correcting agent, for example, can query a knowledge graph or a vector database to ground its responses in prior knowledge.
These chains are easy to implement, and some are available out of the box in the LangChain framework [@langchain].
However, they can behave unpredictably, which increases with the number of links in the chain, and as such should be tightly controlled.
They also add to the computational burden of the system, which is particularly relevant for deployments on end-user devices.
